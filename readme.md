# TMM Read Me

Welcome to the ReadMe file for the Team Management Manager (TMM)
Here, you will find general instructions, references, and most importantly, the Project Blueprint (with specifications)

# Brief description:

TMM aims to make managing time management in a group environment easy. For example, before a manager can set a time for a worker to do a task, they are doomed to do the following: ask! Now add on to the fact that people's schedules change and the fact that the manager might have multiple people to manage; that seems like a good nightmare fuel.
