# CSC207 Final Project Read Me

Brief description:

Problem Domain: Time Management 

This Project will build a TODO/Calendar app where it provides the user with tools
to help manage their todos and time management; where it has features like teams, git-hub updates
weather, smart suggestions...etc. (App simplifies managing todos by connecting different accounts:
for example, git-hub or other workspaces and automatically adds the events and deadlines)

# APIs

- //TODO add a link to a documentation of a API we will use for this project
- API for github
- API for weather
- API for other... add to this
- //SCREENSHOT OF USING API using hopscotch or other website..etc.
- Example of JAVA output (Minimal example of calling api,
  output should show the result of request)
