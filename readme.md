# TMM Read Me

Welcome to the ReadMe file for the Team Management Manager (TMM)
Here, you will find general instructions, references, and most importantly, the Project Blueprint (with specifications)

# Fixes and Tips:

    - Build -> Rebuild Project (can fix some issues)
    - Delete the remote clone and reclone from VCS
    - Go talk to Kyle :)

# Brief description:

TMM aims to make managing time management in a group environment easy. For example, before a manager can set a time for a worker to do a task, they are doomed to do the following: ask! Now add on to the fact that people's schedules change and the fact that the manager might have multiple people to manage; that seems like a good nightmare fuel.

# Specifications

    - Personal Todo List
    - Create and Manage Groups
    - Group Todo Lists
    - Be able to see other's schedule (in the same group)
    - Be able to request and accept Todos from others on empty time slots
    - Different types of Todos (commute, private, work...etc)
    - Smart Suggestions and Auto Update (Bonus)

# Responsibilities

Add your name in the bracket for the things you've worked on substantially
This is done so we can keep track of the responsibilities and if we have problems (for example on how to use a certain method); we know who to ask.
