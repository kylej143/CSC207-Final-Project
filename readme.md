Problem Domain: Time Management

to help manage their todos and time management; where it has features like teams, git-hub updates
weather, smart suggestions...etc. (App simplifies managing todos by connecting different accounts:
for example, git-hub or other workspaces and automatically adds the events and deadlines)
